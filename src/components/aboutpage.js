                        <p className="about-Title-Desc">Hello, I'm Kyle Malice, a dedicated Computer and Information Science student with a deep-rooted passion for technology and its transformative power. Born and raised in Delaware, I've always been driven by curiosity and a desire to step out of my comfort zone. This adventurous spirit has led me to the dynamic field of front-end development, where I constantly embrace new challenges and learning opportunities. Alongside my technical skills, I bring a strong set of soft skills to the table, including problem-solving, effective communication, and teamwork.</p>

                    <div className="glass">
                        <h1 className="about-Title">Skills.</h1>
                        <p className="about-Title-Desc">My academic and personal pursuits have equipped me with proficiency in several programming languages and technologies. I am adept at JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS, which are crucial for front-end development. Additionally, my knowledge extends to Java and C++, gained from my Computer Science courses. Beyond coding, I have a firm grasp on other aspects of technology, including building computers and troubleshooting various tech issues.</p>

                    <div className="glass">
                        <h1 className="about-Title">Education.</h1>
                        <p className="about-Title-Desc">Currently enrolled at Delaware Technical Community College in 2020 and will complete my coursework there at the end of 2023. Following this, Iâ€™m attending the University of Delaware from 2024 to 2025, to receive a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Sciences. During my time at Delaware Technical Community College, I have been immersed in a blend of theoretical learning and practical application. I have completed courses such as Computer Science I-III and Computer Organization, which have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of computer hardware and software. These classes have allowed me to work and progressively build up real-world applications. For instance, I've had the opportunity to work with assembly code, develop software applications in JavaFX, use an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to display distance measurements on an LCD screen connected to my Raspberry Pi, and work with classmates to collaborate using React to build a school portal for the fictional school of Hogwarts University. In my spare time, I enjoy working on side projects that allow me to practice and hone my skills in front-end development. These projects not only reinforce what I've learned in my classes but also provide me with hands-on experience in solving real-world problems. These experiences have not only deepened my technical skills but also honed my ability to collaborate effectively on team projects. I am confident that the knowledge and skills I've acquired thus far will form a solid foundation for my future studies and career as a Frontend Developer.</p>

                        <p className="about-Title-Desc">Outside of my academic and professional interests, I am passionate about health and fitness. I believe in the importance of a balanced lifestyle, and I am currently preparing to compete in a natural bodybuilding show. This hobby not only keeps me physically fit but also instills discipline and perseverance, qualities that I believe are equally important in my professional life.</p>
