## Code Structure

The website uses React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. React's component-based architecture allows for reusability and separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain and understand.

JavaScript is used for handling dynamic content and interactivity on the website. CSS is used for styling and layout, ensuring the website is visually appealing and responsive across different devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   Open your terminal and use the `git clone` command to copy the repository to your local machine. Replace `your-directory` with the path where you want to clone the project.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kyle-malice-portfolio.git your-directory
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**

   Navigate into the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies. This project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
     cd your-directory
     npm install
   ```
3. **Start the development server**

   Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
    ```bash
     npm start
   ```
    This command starts the development server on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your browser to view the project.

    Remember to replace your-username and your-directory with your GitHub username and the directory where you want to clone the project, respectively.


    **This guide assumes that the user has Node.js and npm installed on their machine. If not, they will need to install these before they can run the project.**
